Hello,

My name is Swodesh Sharma, a passionate and driven Electrical Engineering graduate from Pulchowk Engineering College, Tribhuvan University, in Lalitpur, Nepal. I am dedicated to advancing the fields of power systems and renewable energy, with a strong focus on optimizing energy integration and management. My thesis on developing a new control strategy for transformerless grid-connected PV inverters highlights my commitment to innovative solutions in renewable energy.

Throughout my academic journey, I have engaged in numerous research projects, including vision-based transformer models for solar energy assessment and IoT-based load management devices. My professional experiences at Ekbana Solutions and Fusemachine have honed my skills in machine learning, deep learning, and AI applications, enabling me to tackle complex challenges in energy systems and beyond.

In addition to my technical expertise, I have been actively involved in leadership roles, such as serving as the President of the Electrical Club at Pulchowk Campus. I have organized workshops, mentored students, and contributed to national technical exhibitions, fostering a collaborative and innovative environment.

I invite you to explore my GitHub [here](https://github.com/swodesh-2001) to see my projects and contributions to the open-source community. Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/swodesh-sharma) to discuss potential collaborations and opportunities.

Kathmandu, Nepal
