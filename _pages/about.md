Hello,

I am Swodesh Sharma, a passionate and driven Electrical Engineering graduate from Pulchowk Engineering College, Tribhuvan University, in Lalitpur, Nepal. 
I am interested in Power Engineering , topics ranging from Renewable energy intergration to Power Electronics with strong focus on application of AI algorithms.
My undergraduate thesis was on `Developing a new control strategy for transformerless grid-connected PV inverters`.

`I am seeking a Research assistant position on Application of AI on Power System/Power Electronics Converters for grid integration`.

Throughout my academic journey, I have engaged in numerous research projects, ranging from DeepLearning Projects to Power Electronics Converters. 

I have completed 1 year microdegree program from [Fusemachines](https://fusemachines.com/).In addition to my technical expertise, I have been actively involved in leadership roles, such as serving as the `President of the Electrical Club at Pulchowk Campus`. I have organized workshops, mentored students, and contributed to national technical exhibitions `LOCUS`.

Let's connect and make a positive impact in the world of renewable energy and advanced power systems!
